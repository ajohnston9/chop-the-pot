# Chop the Pot!

I got tired of long arguments about how to split multiway all-in pots, especially when there's multiple runouts. This is a single-page, in-browser calculator that should work on mobile and desktop interfaces.

I haven't done much testing, so use at your own risk. I may add support for double-board PLO in the future if there's interest.
